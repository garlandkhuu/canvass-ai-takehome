# Take home assignment

- [x] Create `Project` component based on the `Project card.png` sketch
  Feel free to use any css styling approach for this assignment (styled-components, css modules, `className` props etc.)

- [x] Use data from `data.js` file to generate a list of `Project` components

- [x] Use `Search` input component to filter projects list by name
  This task requires to write a JS function to filter projects if matched with a search query, or some *Nothing found* placeholder if thereâ€™s no match

- [x] Without using any form input libraries implement a tags input component
  The input component that takes text as input and by hitting Enter transforms the input into a tag that is displayed inside the input field. Each tag has a button to remove it.
  Here is the example of Bootstrap plugin: [Bootstrap Tags Input](https://bootstrap-tagsinput.github.io/bootstrap-tagsinput/examples/)

- [x] When you are done with the assignment answer the following questions in this README:
  - How much time did you spend on the assignment?
    - I spent roughly 3.5 hours on this assignment.
    
  - What was the most difficult task?
    - The most difficult task was creating the tag input component, there were many dynamic parts to it and I had to make sure it felt smooth and consistent. Since I had to create the illusion that the entire bar was an input even though the actual input was inside of it, I had to emulate the focus state through React. Dealing with the overflow of the bar was also a bit annoying. To improve upon my solution, I would try and make the input element expand as the user types and then wrap it to the next line if it overflows.
